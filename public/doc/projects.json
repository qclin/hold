They promote conservation and sustainable management by integrating local efforts, political organizing and funding. As a grassroots alliance, they are in need of greater visibility on the array of projects they have initiated since 2008 in promoting sustainable forestry, conservation of migratory birds, technical training, and educational workshops on the sociopolitical effects of conservation in rural communities. Through open dialogue and research, we will design an updated identity, website and an ongoing mapping scheme that imagines through the question of forest representation and their role in ecological and social life of the region.",

A particular focus of the initiative is to combine internal reporting from ground operators with crowd-sourced information, e.g. instant messaging, social networking and RSS feeds, in real-time.

It was backend driven development, which laid the foundations but as project scope widens and more features were added, the views got more complicated and the layouts more cramped. We were bought onto the project to consider the complexity of the dashboard logistics and implement the front end with particular focus on user experience. Our approach was guided by an initial understanding of prevailing structures of the existing REACH platform. The actual technical realisation was then realised in sync with adaptation of standardized design systems. \n\r\n\r The whole procedure can be divided into four major sequences that are mutually dependent. \n\r ### Our challenges: \n\r – global scale -> to address multiple timezones & language localization \n\r – mapping of real time feeds (satellite imagery but also social media) for monitoring \n\r – reporting hierarchies (notifications, crowd-sourced report cards, situation reports)",

From four user (a little be more about each needs, duration) interviews with different expertises of MSF staff, we’ve derived that most are first time users which feel slightly hesitant to interact with the system due to its complexity. Therefore our intuition was to understand their daily tasks and tools of which they are familiar with and how they would potentially use the platform and when necessary to try a walkthrough of the platform for a particular use case."
