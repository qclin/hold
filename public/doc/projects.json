With MSF REACH [REaction Assessment Collaboration Hub](https://blogs.msf.org/bloggers/lucie/msf-reach-new-project-could-help-msf-act-faster-emergency) they introduced a platform that is used by across MSF operation centers in Europe to oversee rapidly evolving emergencies in Asia and support effective decision for dispatching medical resource. A particular focus of the initiative is to combine internal reporting from ground operators with crowd-sourced information, e.g. instant messaging, social networking and RSS feeds, in real-time. We supported MSF to improve their response times in emergency situations and to enhance all information processing activities across the MSF REACH platform.",

        "intro": "The first version of MSF REACH was spearheaded by [Across the Cloud Pty Ltd](https://acrossthecloud.net/) with an established cloud infrastructure, clear REST application protocol and server-side rendering of html pages.  It was backend driven development, which laid the foundations but as project scope widens and more features were added, the views got more complicated and the layouts more cramped. We were bought onto the project to consider the complexity of the dashboard logistics and implement the front end with particular focus on user experience. Our approach was guided by an initial understanding of prevailing structures of the existing REACH platform. The actual technical realisation was then realised in sync with adaptation of standardized design systems. \n\r\n\r The whole procedure can be divided into four major sequences that are mutually dependent. \n\r ### Our challenges: \n\r – global scale -> to address multiple timezones & language localization \n\r – mapping of real time feeds (satellite imagery but also social media) for monitoring \n\r – reporting hierarchies (notifications, crowd-sourced report cards, situation reports)",

From four user (a little be more about each needs, duration) interviews with different expertises of MSF staff, we’ve derived that most are first time users which feel slightly hesitant to interact with the system due to its complexity. Therefore our intuition was to understand their daily tasks and tools of which they are familiar with and how they would potentially use the platform and when necessary to try a walkthrough of the platform for a particular use case."
